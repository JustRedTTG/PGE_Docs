Getting Started
=========

As of Today Pygame Extra 1.6 is only in beta, but here are some things we can
expect in it:

Image Handleing
---------------

Sprites
Settings
Surfaces
Image Handleing
You can import images and set their size and position, the function also
allows you to set the size and position, aswell as automatically calculating
the rect witch means the result is returned in the format [Surface, Rect],
all other functions that use images will only except this format, and it's
really for the better.

Sprites
-------

The most majour part of the Pygame Extra 1.6 update is it's sprites, sprites
can be rotated, scaled, moved and even made dragabble and made animated,
these functions are gonna be all avaliable in the example project provided
with pygame extra 1.6. Some of the included variables are:

* image - the main image and rect of the sprite
* rotation - this is the value that stores the current rotation of a given
  sprite
* position - this tuple stores the X and Y of a given sprite
* rect - aka the size of the sprite or it's container box size
* size - the size multyplier
* new - this is the updated surface, as the original is required to increse
  quality and stop lag and crashes
* refresh - this can be used per given sprite to remmember if the sprite
  should be redrawn or not, this does not effect the code, and is only a per sprite True or False value
* Currently there is some functions that are incomplete, but we hope to finish soon!

Settings
--------
These Settings are gonna be a way to control pygame extra, like the delay of
buttons, the auto update, and those kinds of things, we will expand on this
as needed.

Surfaces
--------

As of now we have no plans for surfaces but we are planning to add some
functionallity of surfaces to pygame extra 1.6!
