Usage
-----

Pygame Extra also known as PGE is sort of like a IDLE for pygame, but instead of using pygame directly, we just import PGE.

From there PGE makes almost every line shorter.

PGE can be used even by begginers, if your one, then welcome to the team, we hope PGE makes your life and learning experience easier!

Installation
------------

To install Pygame Extra simply type this into your shell / terminal:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip3 install pygameextra

After the installation you can do the following to test if Pygame Extra is installed correctly:

.. code-block:: python

You should see the welcoming message.
