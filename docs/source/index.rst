Usage
-----

Pygame Extra also known as PGE is sort of like a idle for pygame, but instead of using pygame directly, we just import PGE.

From there PGE makes almost every line shorter, depending on how long your variables are, XD.

PGE can be used by even begginers, if your one, then welcome to the team, we hope PGE makes your life and learning experience easier!

Installation
------------

To install simply type this into your shell / terminal:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip3 install pygameextra

After the installation you can do the following to test if Pygame Extra is installed correctly:

.. code-block:: python

    import pygameextra as pe

If you run this you'll see a message that will inform you if pygame extra is installed correctly!
